# Abstract 

Closed-loop simulation is essential for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Contemporary sensor simulation methods, such as NeRF and 3DGS, rely predominantly on conditions closely aligned with training data distributions, which are largely confined to forward-driving scenarios. Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers (e.g., lane change, acceleration, deceleration). Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments.
In this paper, we introduce **DriveDreamer4D**, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. 
Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos, where structured conditions are explicitly leveraged to control the spatial-temporal consistency of traffic elements. Besides, the cousin data training strategy is proposed to facilitate merging real and synthetic data for optimizing 4DGS. To our knowledge, **DriveDreamer4D** is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios.
Experimental results reveal that **DriveDreamer4D** significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID  by 32.1%, 46.4%, and 16.3% compared to PVG, S3Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, **DriveDreamer4D** markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 22.6%, 43.5%, and 15.6% in the NTA-IoU metric.

# Prepare
**NOTE** To facilitate the calculation of metrics, we have updated our data processing code. If you previously downloaded our dataset, you can simply download the label.pkl file from the provided link and place it in the ./data/waymo/processed/validation/005 directory. Additionally, if you previously downloaded our checkpoint, please move the checkpoint and config file to the ./exp/pvg_example/005 directory. 

Download data ([Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=8butQ86ZNkvjio8vK_1YZA&pwd=3yiv), [Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19TIK5UNSjVLOLfQWjfDA51N3x3a0voWR?usp=sharing))  and extract it to the ./data/waymo/ directory.

Download checkpoint ([Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=RDMQEHSMJPjJDiokK-f4og&pwd=2kvi), [Google](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gHjOd6y2Pd7hk10bzMjE99kgWOB4T2lu?usp=sharing)) to ./exp/pvg_example/005

Furthermore, if you want to generate the label.pkl of other scenarios, you can do so by running the script located at datasets/prepare_data_label.py.
```
python datasets/prepare_data_label.py --data_root /PATH/TO/YOUR/WAYMO/SOURCE/DATA --scene_ids specific_scene_ids
